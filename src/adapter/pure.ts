 * result's UTF-16 length equals RemNote's own rich-text offset space — the
 * space `editor.selectText` ranges and `getSelection().range` are measured
 * in. Concretely:
 *
 *   - plain string segments and `{i:'m'}` text runs count their UTF-16 units
 *     (an emoji inside text is 2 units in both spaces);
 *   - every OTHER element (rem reference `q`, image `i`, LaTeX `x`, audio,
 *     card delimiter, …) is ATOMIC: RemNote gives it exactly 2 units, so it
 *     becomes the single astral placeholder ATOMIC_CH (2 units, 1 code
 *     point — one caret stop, which is also what `moveCaret` counts).
 *
 * The old approach (`richText.toString`, which expands a reference to its
 * full display name) shifted every offset right of the element by
 * name-length − 2: motions and deletes on formatted lines hit the wrong
 * characters, and the engine believed the line was longer than the editor
 * did. That was the user-visible "cursor thinks it's at EOL / chaos on
 * formatted lines" instability.
